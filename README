Introduction
============

Cloudless is an event-driven communication framework built on-top of 0MQ
to provide fast, reliable, easy-to-use library to address most application
needs for communication over in-process or inter-process transports.

Building and Installation

See the INSTALL file included with the distribution.

Dependencies
============

Boost library is required, specifically the threading library, smart_ptr, and bind.
0MQ library is required, either 3.x or 2.x versions are supported.
Crypto++ library is required, preferably version v5.6.1.
Doxygen is optional but it is required if you desire documentation to be generated.
